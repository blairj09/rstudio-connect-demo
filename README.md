# connect_demo

This repository provides a few samples to assist with the demonstration of [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/).

## Lead Scoring API
This is a [`plumber`](https://www.rplumber.io) API that demonstrates how R code can be turned into APIs managed by Connect.

## Sales Report
This is a parameterized RMarkdown report that simulates what a sales report may look like for an organization. It is used to demonstrate how parameterized reports can be run and scheduled using Connect.
